                             JAVA_HOME

1. Legacy use of JAVA_HOME

   As of the latest versions of java-common there really should
   be no need for JAVA_HOME as Java(TM) should be completely
   integrated with your Debian GNU/Linux system.

   For reference, the setting of JAVA_HOME for Sun Java is:
     JAVA_HOME=/@TOP@/@jdiralias@

2. Selecting @basename@ as the default Java(TM) implementation

   Please see README.alternatives for instructions on how
   to make @basename@ executables and man pages the default on your system.


3. For developer information about this packaging of Java(TM) for Debian 
   please visit:
 
   https://jdk-distros.dev.java.net/

   In addition to technical information the jdk-distros site
   provides forums to discuss packaging of Java for Linux
   (and OpenSolaris) and to discuss the new Operating System Distributor 
   License for Java (DLJ).
