openjdk-7 for Debian/Ubuntu
---------------------------

The OpenJDK build is configured --with-additional-vms to build with
different virtual machines.  The original implementation of the hotspot
VM is only available on the amd64, i386, lpia and sparc architectures.
Other VM's are CACAO, providing a just in time compiler on several
architectures (although the VM implementation is incomplete), and Zero,
providing a byte code interpreter for every architecture.  On some
architectures Zero is built with JIT support using shark (still considered
experimental).

To use a different VM other than the default, use

	java -cacao|-zero|-shark

or for the java tools, use

	<tool name> -J-cacao|-J-zero|-J-shark.

The zero build on the ix86 architectures is built with shark (just in time
compiler); to use the zero build without shark support, use the `-Xint'
option to operate in interpreted-only mode.

On some architectures (currently armel and powerpc, when built against
llvm-2.6) which use ther zero vm as the default, the openjdk-7-jre-zero
package contains the shark vm.

To change the default permanently, edit /etc/java-6-openjdk/jvm.cfg.

The CACAO VM can be found in the icedtea-7-jre-cacao package, the Zero/Shark
VM can be found in the openjdk-7-jre-zero package (on the architectures
where the Hotspot VM is available).

Please look for further documentation in the directory
/usr/share/doc/openjdk-7-jre/ .

The package openjdk-7-jre-headless ships a cgi script
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/bin/java-rmi.cgi that you must integrate
into your webserver setup manually if you need it. It is not activated
automatically.


Note for non-reparenting window manager users
---------------------------------------------

If you are using a non-reparenting window manager, such as ratpoison, awesome
or dwm, some Java graphical applications using the AWT toolkit will only
display empty grey windows, as described in but #508650.

There are two solutions to work around this issue:
1. mask your window manager as one of the non-reparenting ones supported by AWT,
   using the wmname <http://tools.suckless.org/wmname> tool from the dwm-tools
   package:
   $ wmname LG3D
2. set the environment variable _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING:
   $ export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=true

You can automate these tasks by writing them to your ~/.xsessionrc:
$ cat >> ~/.xsessionrc <<EOF
export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=true
EOF


IcedTea NPPlugin
----------------

IcedTea provides a java plugin for at least mozilla based browsers.  It is
not yet 100% with the closed source plugin, but much improved to the former
GCJPlugin.  If you experience problems with the plugin, start your browser
from the command line with the environment variable ICEDTEAPLUGIN_DEBUG set,
and attach this output to a bug report.  You usually should not expect a
quick fix, if the applet code is closed source, or only accessible after
creating accounts for external web services using these applets.
