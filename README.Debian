openjdk-6 for Debian
--------------------

Please look for further documentation in the directory
/usr/share/doc/openjdk-6-jre/ .

The package openjdk-6-jre-headless ships a cgi script
/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/bin/java-rmi.cgi that you must integrate
into your webserver setup manually if you need it. It is not activated
automatically.
