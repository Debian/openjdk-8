                             JAVA_HOME

1. Legacy use of JAVA_HOME

   As of the latest versions of java-common there really should
   be no need for JAVA_HOME as Java(TM) should be completely
   integrated with your Debian GNU/Linux system.


2. Selecting OpenJDK 7 as the default Java(TM) implementation

   Please see README.alternatives for instructions on how
   to make OpenJDK 7 executables and man pages the default on your system.
